This is it. My new blog is live. Horray o/

First of all, **welcome**.

For those who already knew me and were already following me on my old blog, **welcome back**.

Here, I will mainly write about front-end development (React, Gatsby, everything that comes with it and that I like), my pretty city, the high-tech world etc...

I will also probably write more _"opinionated"_ posts on subjects that fascinate me, that drive me crazy or that annoy me.

Finally, I will also use my blog to upload **snippets** that I regularly put on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Manoz). I usually don't share them often but I thought if the subject or snippet is interesting, it might a good idea to share it.

Don't expect a lot of quality content very quickly. I still have to work on some graphic "styles" on this blog and right now I have very little time to write.

I've got a lot on my mind, so it'll come fast.

Oh and also, the whole website sources are on [Github](https://github.com/Manoz/k-legrand.com). I have a lot to say about how I built this website using Gatsby. Blog post coming... _soon_.

In the meantime I wish you a good reading (of nothing) and see you soon!
